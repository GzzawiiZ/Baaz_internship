# Internship Repository - Data Scientist

Welcome to the internship repository for Baaz, where I worked as a Data Scientist. This repository contains four codes that I developed during my internship. Each code serves a specific purpose related to data analysis and modeling. Below is a brief description of each code:

## 1. GD-mini patch and Stochastic GD.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook file (`GD-mini patch and Stochastic GD.ipynb`) contains the implementation of two optimization algorithms for gradient descent: GD-mini patch and Stochastic GD. These algorithms are commonly used in machine learning for finding the optimal parameters of a model by minimizing a loss function. The notebook provides an explanation of the algorithms and demonstrates their usage on a specific dataset.

## 2. GD.ipynb

The `GD.ipynb` notebook focuses on the implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm. Gradient Descent is a popular optimization algorithm used to iteratively update the model parameters in order to minimize a given cost function. This notebook includes a step-by-step explanation of the Gradient Descent algorithm and demonstrates its application on a sample dataset.

## 3. Linear Regression Normal Equation.ipynb

The `Linear Regression Normal Equation.ipynb` notebook showcases the implementation of Linear Regression using the Normal Equation. Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm that predicts a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The Normal Equation provides a closed-form solution to compute the optimal model parameters. This notebook explains the Normal Equation method and provides an example of its application.

## 4. Linear Regression.ipynb

The `Linear Regression.ipynb` notebook focuses on the implementation of Linear Regression using gradient-based optimization, specifically the Gradient Descent algorithm. This notebook provides a detailed explanation of Linear Regression, the cost function used, and the step-by-step process of implementing Gradient Descent for this task. It also includes an example of applying Linear Regression to a dataset and interpreting the results.

Feel free to explore and utilize these codes as a reference or starting point for your own projects. Each notebook is accompanied by code cells, markdown cells, and explanations to guide you through the implementation and understanding of the algorithms.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Enjoy your exploration of the repository!

Best regards,
